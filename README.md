# Final Project: BRICS_US

# Steps for Downloading the World Bank dataset in Jupyter Notebook

*   Step 1: from the website data.worldbank.org find which indicator is required for the analysis
*   Step 2: find the indicator code for the Metadata. For example for the GDP Growth Rate (Annual) use  "NY.GDP.MKTP.KD.ZG"
*   Step 3: Use country codes such BRA, IND, CNA, RUS, ZAF and US for Brazil, India, China, South Africa and the United States, and "all" for the world.
*   Step 4: After printing the dataframe, check for missing values and replace them using economic rationale
*   Step 5: Export data set using python as excel/csv files for Brazil, Russia, India, China, South Africa and United States




# Economic Growth and Inflation after COVID-19 in BRICS_US

Brazil, Russia, India, China, South Africa (BRICS) combined with the United States have a combined area of about 32.84% of the global land area, and  a combined population of about 46.25% the global population. Their economies, as a result, are expected to affect global business activities significantly.

The effect was COVID was experienced by these nations both in terms of the effect on growth rates of the gross domestic product (GDP) and inflation (price rise). Comparison of 2019 (one year before COVID-19) with the year 2020 shows this effect. There is variability in the effect felt among the BRICS_US nations with China having the least impact (See the maps below).

The maps were generating using a dataset from the World Bank database and by using python in Jupyter Notebook.

As we can see from the map, Brazil, Russia, USA and India experienced a decline in GDP and the only China has experienced in increase in GDP. Apart from the BRICS_US, some West African countries and Australia also experienced an increase in GDP.

## Inflation Map for 2020

The following Map related to inflation is a reflection of what happened to GDP. There has been inflation in all countries, with relatively less in China. If one looks at the present situation, the inflation is rapidly increasing around the world. The following Wall Street Journal discusses this issue:

The negatively affects business activities and results into a recession.
