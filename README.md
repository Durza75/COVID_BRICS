# COVID_BRICS

## Overview of Business Interest Analysis

In this section, we are going to analyze the business potential in BRICS countries. 

The BRICS countries are either located in the places that are perfect for coffee bean growing, or located near the countries that largely consume coffee bean. So we are going to investigate the possibility of building coffee processing facilities in BRICS country. To develop ground coffee/instant coffee production line, we need to make sure the country can supply clean water, stable access to electricity and fast logistics. 


We will use coffee consumption data, consumer price index data, covid cases data, electricity generation, and water supply data to find out which country has the potential to build coffee bean processing facility and which country would have the potential to consume the products.


The impact of covid pandemic to the coffee market will also be discussed. 

## Machine Learning 

The liner regression analysis will be performed on the coffee consumption/price and covid cases to see the relationship between the coffee market and pandemic. The liner regression analysis will also be used to predict the coffee consuption after covid. 

Random Forest Regressor Model will be used in the prediction of engergy and water supply. 

## Description for resources 

- The Consumer Price Index (CPI) is a measure that examines the weighted average of prices of a basket of consumer goods and services, such as transportation, food, and medical care. It is calculated by taking price changes for each item in the predetermined basket of goods and averaging them. Changes in the CPI are used to assess price changes associated with the cost of living.
