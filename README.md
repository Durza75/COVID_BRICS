# Final Project Proposal: COVID BRICS
## Overview 
Using national income as the main criterion, the team will be looking into the economic performance of BRICS countries (Brazil, Russia, India, China, South Africa) and the US over the past 20 years and how COVID has had an effect on their development. We will link that performance with access to key variables like electricity, water, health facilities, education and business climate. Finally, by using Machine Language we will make several projections in terms of the future incomes for these countries.

Additionally, the team will analyze the possibility of building a coffee processing facility in one of the BRICS countries. The team hopes this analysis will reveal which country has the most potential for building coffee processing factories as well as the potential for higher coffee consumption rates.

## Why is this Important?
COVID has had a profound impact on the world economy. The team would like to investigate COVIDâ€™s long term economic effect on developing countries and compare that to the US, in hopes of identifying key factors most affected by pandemics, as well as predict the future state of the six aforementioned countries. 

## The Data
 - Confirmed global cases of COVID19 
 - GDP (Gross Domestic Product) by our selected countries from 2000 to 2020 

 ## Data Science Methodologies Used
